                        Demand.io (or "we", "us" or "our") hosts and operates an e-commerce ecosystem (the "Platform")
                        through a network of innovative shopping apps, websites and digital platforms, including
                        knoji.com, dealspotr.com, stylespotter.com, dealspotr.com and other sites we may add, e.g.,
                        fave.ly (individually, a "Site" and collectively, the "Sites"). Among other things, we help (a)
                        social media influencers and creators ("Influencers") connect and collaborate with brands,
                        advertisers and marketing agencies ("Brands") to create content ("Content") for sponsored
                        marketing campaigns ("Campaign"), and (b) Brands create and run Campaigns by connecting and
                        collaborating with Influencers to create Content for their Campaigns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We sometimes refer to those who use or access our Platform or Services as "Users",
                        and "your" or "you", as the context may require. If you access the Platform or use the Services
                        on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the
                        authority to bind that legal entity and, in such event, "your" or "you" means that legal entity.
                        In addition, in these Terms, unless the context requires otherwise, words in one gender include
                        all genders and words in the singular include the plural and vice-versa.

                    <p>
                        The following details our Privacy Policy for the Sites and describes the types of information we
                        gather from those persons visiting the Sites and how we use such information. We understand the
                        importance of privacy and accordingly, treat all information received in a responsible manner.
                        This Privacy Policy applies to all of our Sites, mobile applications and the services offered
                        through those Sites and mobile applications, including online referral services, information
                        resources, product information, social networking services, shopping features, coupons, reviews,
                        ratings, forums, and email services (collectively, the "Services"). We collect information about
                        you through our Sites to improve your experience and to communicate with you about our Services,
                        contests and promotions offered through our Sites. As described in this Privacy Policy, we may
                        share your information within our network of Sites and mobile applications, and under certain
                        circumstances, with third parties that provide services on our behalf or with whom we have
                        partnered to offer a service.

                    <p>
                        Please note Demand.io is not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party websites (even
                        if we offer links to those third-party websites at one of our Sites) and they are under no
                        obligation to comply with this Privacy Policy. Before visiting another website and before
                        providing any information to the party that operates or advertises on that third-party website,
                        Users should review the privacy policy and practices of that website. Please further note,
                        depending on a User's particular interaction with our Sites (e.g., Users who solely navigate one
                        of our Sites and those Users who create an account and use the Services), different portions of
                        this Privacy Policy may apply to each User.
                        By using any of our Sites or Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Please
                        read this privacy policy carefully. By accessing or using the sites, you acknowledge that you

                        To make our Site and Service more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third
                        party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating
                        system, Internet Protocol ("IP") address (a number that is automatically assigned to your
                        computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or
                        a date/time stamp for your visit.

                    <p>
                        As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log
                        files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider ("ISP"),
                        referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this
                        information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users' movements around the Site,
                        gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Site and
                        Service to our users' needs. For example, some of the information may be collected so that when
                        you visit the Site or use our Service again, it will recognize you and the information could
                        then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. Except
                        as noted in this Privacy Policy, we do not link this automatically collected data to Personal
                        Data.

                    <p>
                        Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. "Cookies" are small pieces of
                        information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing the
                        website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and
                        persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a
                        more personal and interactive user experience. This type of information is collected to make our
                        Site and Service more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special
                        interests and needs.

                    <p>
                        In addition, we use Pixel Tags (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web
                        bugs). "Pixel Tags" are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to
                        cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are
                        stored on a user's computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel
                        Tags also allow us to send email messages in a format that users can read, and they tell us
                        whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of
                        interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a
                        user. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to our users' Personal Data.

                        email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or
                        through other means. We do this to help improve our Site and Service, for example to provide
                        relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times
                        a particular link was clicked on.

                        We use Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Site. Google Analytics uses Cookies to
                        collect information such as how often users visit the Site and use Services, what pages they
                        visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to our Site. We use the information we get
                        from Google Analytics only to improve our Site and Service. Google Analytics collects only the
                        IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Site, rather than your name or other
                        personally identifying information. We do not combine the information generated through the use
                        of Google Analytics with your Personal Data. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent
                        Cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Site and
                        use Services, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google's ability to use and share
                        information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Site and use of Service is
                        restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.

We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet that are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Site cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party. Despite this, we will make any legally-required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored Personal Information to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system. We also require you to enter a password to access your Account information. Please do not disclose your Account password to unauthorized people. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while Demand.io uses reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Data, Demand.io cannot guarantee its absolute security.
